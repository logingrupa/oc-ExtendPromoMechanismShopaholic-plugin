        <p>When using this promotional mechanism, the <strong>Discount Value</strong> field represents the <strong>exact price</strong> you want to set for each qualifying item.</p>
        <p>For example, if you want all items to cost $7.20 when a customer has 20 or more items in their cart, enter <strong>7.20</strong> as the Discount Value.</p>
        <p>The system will automatically apply this target price to all eligible items whose original price is higher than the target price.</p>
